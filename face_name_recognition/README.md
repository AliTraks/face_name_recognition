# Professional Face Recognition System (Prototype / Alpha)

📦 **Status:** Early-stage prototype — functional but still evolving.

This is a **real-time face recognition system** that allows you to:

- **Enroll people** by providing multiple images (3–5 per person) along with their name
- **Recognize people** from single images or live webcam feed
- **Log recognition events** in a local database for tracking
- Use **confidence scoring** to indicate recognition certainty (high / low / unknown)
- Interact via a **simple GUI** for easy image selection, enrollment, and live recognition

⚠️ This is a **prototype / alpha version** — improvements and new features are coming soon!

This project is fully **open-source**.

Anyone is welcome to:

- Improve the recognition accuracy
- Add new features
- Optimize performance
- Suggest ideas

If you have an idea, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
